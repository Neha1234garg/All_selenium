Workflow: goto testng.xml if you wamnt to run the project.
to see its flow goto HomePageTest.java file in com.project.Reporter, after that go to next file that is SignUpTest.java that is also under com.project.Reporter package.
In my Framework there are Packages based on differentt functionalities say com.appdirect.Pages is containg all the java files for each page, checker package contains all the validations file for each page, exceptionhandling is used to handle exceptions
